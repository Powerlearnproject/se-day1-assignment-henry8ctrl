Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles,methods andols
to develope  and maintain high quality software systems.
It is used in tech industrieas to develop software applications that help in various human
day to day activities such as communication and entertainment


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.The development of programming languages,this was in the 1940s-1950s
2.The recognition of softwatre engineering as a discipline, occured in the 1960s
3.The rise of agile methadologies, occured mainly in the 2000s


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Requirements;this is finding the user needs and software requirment that will
  help in developing high quality systems.
2.Designing;this is creating and developing high quality designs of the software
  architecter and user interface 
3.implementation; this is actualising the designs by writing down code
4.Testing; seeing if the system is of high quality before disposing it to the user
5.Deployment; releasimg the software to the user
6.Maintenance; this is providing ongoing support to the user and giving out 
software updates from time to time


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
1.waterfall has a linear and sequental structure with distinc phases while agile has an iterative and ncreamental structure with work divided into sprints for 
  each iterations.
2.In terms of flexibility waterfall is rigid as changes are difficult to make once a phase is completed while agile is highly adaptable,changes can be made 
  continuously based on feedback.
3.In watefall customer involvement is minimal especially during development while in agile customer involvement is highas customers are involved throghout the 
  process.
4.Delivery in waterfall is done at the end of the project while in agile delivery is done frequently.

-Waterfall scenerio;developing a project with well-defined requirements that are unlikely to change, such as developing a software for a regulated industry.
-Agile scenerio; developing a project where requirements are expected to evolve such as creating a mobile app.



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1.Software Developer; writes down code and implements software solutions
2.Quality Assurance Engineer; ensures that the software is of high quality and meets the user's requirments
3.Project Manager; overviews everything,planning,designing,production and deployment of software products


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs are essential tools in the software development process because they provide a comprehensive environment that intergrates various development tools in a single application.
Example;Visual Studio code is a popular IDE that supports multiple programming languages and has a vast librarry of extensions, making it highly versatile for sifferent types of projects.

VCS is critical in software development because it manages changes to the source code over time.
Example;Git is a widely used version control system that enables distributed development,allowing teams to collaborate effectively, track changes, and manage project history.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
The callenges include;
1.Changing reqiuremnts,it is overcomed by;-Frequent communication to ensure changes in reqire ments are understood and intergrated as smmoothly as possible.
                                          -Version conrol,using a robust version control system to cope with the changes and even revert to the original if need
                                          -Prototyping and MVPs,by developing prototypes and miniture viable products enales one to gather feedback and 
                                           change in requirements before full scale development.
2.Tight dealines, can be overcomed by;-Agile methodology,break the project into smaller sprints allowing for increamental delivery of work.
                                      -Priotization, focus on delivering the most critical features first which ensures that effective functionality is done 
                                       with before the deadline.
                                      -Time management, use timeboxing techniques where each task is allocated a specific time ensuring the team stays on track
3.Technical debt, is overcomed by;-Automated testing, use automated testing to catch bugs and issues early
                                  -Code reviews, implement thorough code reviews to catch and adress issues early
                                  -Debt tracking,keep a technical debt register to document and prioritize debt.
                      


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1.Unit;this is testing of individual parts of the system
2.Intergration; this is the testing of the interations of different parts of the system
3.System;this is the testing of the entire system
4.Acceptance;this is the testing of software against user reqiurements to see if it meets the user needs


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering i a process of bending innstructions for an AI inorder for it to give the required or needed outcome.

importance-
prompt engineering helps avoid confusing answers by making your quetions clear and specific so that the AI understand exactly what you need.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Example; instead of asking an AI to "give the history of adoption of dogs", you can ask it "what specific time in histry did man start adopting dogs".
